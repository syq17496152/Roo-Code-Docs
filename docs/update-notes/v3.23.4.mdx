# Roo Code 3.23.4 Release Notes (2025-01-13)

This release includes bug fixes, UI improvements, and better organization.

## Bug Fixes

* **Custom Modes**: Fixed crashes when custom modes configuration files were empty or contained null content (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5526](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5526))
* **File Listing**: Fixed issue where the [`list_files`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/list-files) tool incorrectly showed directories that should be ignored according to .gitignore patterns (thanks X9VoiD!) ([#5394](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5394))

## QOL Improvements

* **Chat Interface**: Improved tooltip consistency across chat interface buttons for a more polished experience (thanks daniel-lxs!) ([#5528](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5528))
* **Interface Organization**: Cleaner Roo Code view header with reduced visual clutter - less frequently used actions moved to VS Code's overflow menu (thanks dlab-anton!) ([#3060](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/3060))
* **Command Organization**: Better organized VS Code extension interface with commands properly grouped in overflow menus ([#5525](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5525))
* **Indexing Status**: Improved visual alignment and consistency of the indexing status indicator ([#5523](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5523))
* **Interface Icons**: More consistent and clearer icons throughout the interface for better visibility of codebase indexing status ([#5520](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5520))
